TITLE: SOLVING QUANTUM SYSTEMS NUMERICALLY

This folder contains the scripts used to produce results for the Y3 ‘Computational Physics Project’. These scripts were created using the Spyder 4 IDE.


CONTENTS OF FOLDER: 
• README.txt
• newton-cotes.py
• monte_carlo.py
• Plots used - Folder containing all the plots used in report


Modules ‘newton-cotes.py’ and ‘monte_carlo.py’ contain the source code which define the functions used and produces results belonging to their respective sections.

Each first cell in ‘newton-cotes.py’ and ‘monte_carlo.py’  define the functions and methods to be used in answering the questions for the report. The following cells in each script contain the code that reproduces the results and plots used in the report in order. Segments of where the respective cells correspond to the report have been marked in each cell for clarity. Functions have also been 'docstring'-ed to explain all the arguments and returns of each function.

Each script should be able to reproduce all the results and plots used in the write-up. Note that the scripts utilise cells to separate sections of the results.
